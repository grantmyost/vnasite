		  	<p>Second Life Studios is a Kansas City artisan collaborative. We are carpenters, metal workers, leathersmiths, designers, consultants, mad scientists, local boys and facial hair aficionados.  We are craftsman that believe that small business can make our city a better place, that business is just one form of community development. We believe in the legacy of the handmade and the value of apprenticeship. We are convinced that the easy way is mediocre and that mediocracy is lame.</p>

		  	<p>Today SLS includes carpentry, metal, artisan concrete, leather working and graphic design. We reuse and repurpose old materials to make new creations. Our goal is to be a one stop shop for anything you can dream of. Our group began in 2009 with the start of Adventure Indoors Woodworking. In 2012, the team grew with the addition of Henrich & Co and The KC Map Room. Together these small shops became Second Life Studios. This year Concrete Labs and 2nd Story Leather joined our team.</p>
